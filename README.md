# Stepping.NET
.NET library to implement distributed [BASE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) jobs with decentralization transaction managers. You can use Stepping alone or as an SDK of DTM's [2-phase messaging](https://en.dtm.pub/practice/msg.html) since it is compatible with the latter.
